- ✅ Throw error if expense not found
- ✅ Throw error if company not found
- ✅ Handle case-insensitive currency comparison

**File: `expense-service.test.ts`**
- ✅ All 22 existing tests pass (no breaking changes)

### Integration Tests - All Passing ✅
**File: `workflow-currency-conversion.test.ts`**
- ✅ Convert currency when all approvers approve
- ✅ Still approve expense if currency conversion fails
- ✅ Not convert currency when expense is rejected

**Total: 31 tests passing**

## Implementation Verification

### ✅ Currency Conversion Method
- `ExpenseService.convertExpenseCurrency()` implemented
- Fetches company's base currency
- Uses CurrencyService for exchange rates (with 1-hour caching)
- Stores converted amount in expense record
- Logs all actions to ApprovalHistory

### ✅ Workflow Integration
- `WorkflowEngine.convertAndApproveExpense()` implemented
- Called when all approvers approve
- Handles conversion failures gracefully
- Expense still approved if conversion fails

### ✅ Admin Override Integration
- `ApprovalService.adminOverrideApproval()` updated
- Includes currency conversion before approval
- Handles conversion failures gracefully

### ✅ Error Handling
- Conversion failures don't block approvals
- All errors logged to ApprovalHistory
- Detailed error messages for debugging

### ✅ Caching Strategy
- Exchange rates cached for 1 hour in Redis
- Reduces API calls to Exchange Rate API
- Automatic cache invalidation after TTL

## Requirements Coverage

All requirements from task 7.2 are satisfied:
- ✅ Remove currency conversion from expense creation
- ✅ Store only original amount and currency on submission
- ✅ Implement convertExpenseCurrency method called during approval
- ✅ Fetch exchange rates from API when manager/admin views expense
- ✅ Store converted amount when expense is approved
- ✅ Cache exchange rates for 1 hour to minimize API calls

## Code Quality

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Detailed logging for audit trail
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

Task 7.2 is complete and ready for the next task (7.3 - Create expense submission API endpoints).
