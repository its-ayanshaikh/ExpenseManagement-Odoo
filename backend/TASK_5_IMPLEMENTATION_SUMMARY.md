# Task 5 Implementation Summary: User Management Service and API

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive User Management Service and API with full CRUD operations, role management, and manager assignment capabilities.

## Implemented Components

### 1. UserService (backend/src/services/UserService.ts)

#### CRUD Operations
- **createUser()**: Creates new users with validation for email uniqueness, manager relationships, and role permissions
- **getUserById()**: Retrieves user by ID
- **getUsersByCompany()**: Retrieves all users for a specific company
- **updateUser()**: Updates user information with validation
- **deleteUser()**: Deletes user with comprehensive validation for pending approvals and managed users

#### Role and Manager Assignment
- **assignRole()**: Assigns roles with validation for users managing others
- **assignManager()**: Assigns managers with circular relationship validation
- **validateNoCircularManagerRelationship()**: Prevents circular manager hierarchies
- **getDirectReports()**: Gets direct reports for a manager
- **getManagerHierarchy()**: Gets complete hierarchy for a manager

#### Key Validations Implemented
- Email uniqueness validation
- Manager role validation (must be MANAGER or ADMIN)
- Company isolation (managers must belong to same company)
- Circular manager relationship prevention
- Pending approval validation before deletion
- Manager dependency validation before role changes

### 2. Updated User Routes (backend/src/routes/users.ts)

#### API Endpoints Implemented
- **POST /api/users** - Create new user (Admin only)
- **GET /api/users** - List all company users (Admin only)
- **GET /api/users/:id** - Get user details (Admin or self)
- **PUT /api/users/:id** - Update user (Admin only)
- **DELETE /api/users/:id** - Delete user (Admin only)
- **PUT /api/users/:id/role** - Change user role (Admin only)
- **PUT /api/users/:id/manager** - Assign/remove manager (Admin only)

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific error codes for different validation failures
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500)
- Detailed error messages for client debugging
- Service-level error propagation

#### Security Features
- Role-based access control enforcement
- Company isolation validation
- Self-deletion prevention for admins
- Authentication and authorization middleware integration

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 2.1 (User Creation)
✅ Admin can create Employees and Managers with required information

### Requirement 2.2 (User Management)
✅ Admin can view, update, and delete users with proper validation

### Requirement 2.3 (Role Assignment)
✅ Admin can assign Employee and Manager roles with validation

### Requirement 2.4 (Manager Relationships)
✅ Admin can assign managers with circular relationship prevention

### Requirement 2.5 (Role Changes)
✅ Role changes update permissions immediately with validation

### Requirement 2.6 (Deletion Validation)
✅ Users with pending approvals or managed users cannot be deleted

### Requirement 2.7 (User Display)
✅ Admin can view all users with roles and manager relationships

### Requirement 7.1 (Role-Based Permissions)

## Technical Features

### Data Validation
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters)
- Role enum validation
- Manager relationship validation

### Database Operations
- Proper transaction handling
- Optimized queries with count operations
- Safe deletion with dependency checks
- Efficient company-scoped queries

### Service Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns between routes and service layer
- Comprehensive error handling and propagation
- Reusable validation logic
- Type-safe operations with TypeScript

### API Design
- RESTful endpoint design
- Consistent response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error responses with codes

## Testing Considerations
The implementation includes comprehensive validation that can be tested:
- User creation with various invalid inputs
- Manager assignment with circular relationships
- Role changes with dependency validation
- Deletion attempts with pending approvals
- Company isolation enforcement

## Next Steps
This User Management Service provides the foundation for:
- Expense submission workflows (users can submit expenses)
- Approval workflows (managers can approve expenses)
- Role-based UI components in the frontend
- User hierarchy-based reporting and analytics
