# Task 7 Implementation Summary: Expense Service and Basic API

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete Expense Service and API endpoints with full CRUD operations, currency conversion, and role-based access control.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Expense Model (`backend/src/models/Expense.ts`)
- Complete Expense model class with database mapping
- Methods for CRUD operations (save, findById, findBySubmitterId, findByCompanyId, deleteById, updateStatus)
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and database conversion methods
- Support for both original and converted currency amounts

### 2. ExpenseService (`backend/src/services/ExpenseService.ts`)
- **createExpense**: Creates expenses with automatic currency conversion to company default currency
- **getExpenseById**: Retrieves single expense by ID
- **getExpensesByUser**: Gets expenses for a specific user with optional filters
- **getExpensesByCompany**: Gets all company expenses (Admin only) with optional filters
- **getPendingApprovalsForUser**: Gets expenses pending approval for managers
- **updateExpense**: Updates expenses (only before approval) with currency re-conversion
- **deleteExpense**: Deletes expenses (only before approval)
- **getExpensesByManagerReports**: Gets expenses from manager's direct reports
- **canUserAccessExpense**: Checks if user can access specific expense

### 3. API Endpoints (`backend/src/routes/expenses.ts`)
Updated all expense endpoints to use the ExpenseService:

#### POST /api/expenses (Employee)
- Creates new expense with currency conversion
- Validates all required fields and data types
- Automatically converts to company default currency
- Returns complete expense data including converted amounts

#### GET /api/expenses (Role-filtered)
- **Employee**: Only their own expenses
- **Manager**: Own expenses + direct reports' expenses
- **Admin**: All company expenses
- Supports filtering by status, date range, category, and submitter (admin only)

#### GET /api/expenses/:id
- Retrieves single expense with proper access control
- Uses ExpenseService.canUserAccessExpense for permission checking
- Returns complete expense details

#### PUT /api/expenses/:id (Employee, before approval)
- Updates expense with validation
- Recalculates currency conversion if amount or currency changed
- Only allows updates for pending expenses by the submitter

#### DELETE /api/expenses/:id (Employee, before approval)
- Deletes expense with proper access control
- Only allows deletion for pending expenses by the submitter

#### GET /api/expenses/pending-approvals (Manager/Admin)
- Returns expenses pending approval for the current user
- Managers see expenses from their direct reports
- Admins see all pending company expenses

## Key Features Implemented

### Currency Conversion
- Automatic conversion to company default currency on expense creation
- Stores both original amount/currency and converted amount/currency
- Re-conversion on expense updates if amount or currency changes
- Comprehensive error handling for conversion failures
- Currency code validation before conversion
- Graceful handling of API timeouts and unavailable services

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Employee**: Can only create, view, update, and delete their own expenses
- **Manager**: Can view own expenses + direct reports' expenses, access pending approvals
- **Admin**: Can view all company expenses, access all pending approvals
- Company isolation enforced across all operations

### Data Validation
- Amount validation (positive numbers only)
- Currency code validation (3-letter ISO codes)
- Date validation (no future dates)
- Required field validation
- Category and description validation

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all service operations
- Specific error codes and messages for different failure scenarios
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 403, 404, 500)
- Currency conversion error handling with user-friendly messages
- Database operation error handling

### Filtering and Querying
- Filter by expense status (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)
- Filter by date range (startDate, endDate)
- Filter by category
- Filter by submitter (Admin only)
- Proper sorting (newest first)

## Database Integration
- Uses existing PostgreSQL database with Knex.js
- Proper transaction handling
- Efficient queries with appropriate indexes
- Company isolation at database level

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 3.1-3.7 (Expense Submission)
✅ Complete expense submission with all required fields
✅ Multi-currency support with validation
✅ Expense history viewing with status tracking
✅ Proper validation and error handling

### Requirement 5.1, 5.7 (Manager Approval Access)
✅ Managers can view pending approvals
✅ Managers can view team expenses

### Requirement 7.2-7.3 (Role-Based Permissions)
✅ Employee role restrictions implemented
