# Task 8.1 Implementation Summary: ApprovalRule Model and Service

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ApprovalRule model and service with full CRUD operations and comprehensive validation for all rule types as specified in the requirements.

## Files Created

### 1. `backend/src/models/ApprovalRule.ts`
- **ApprovalRule class**: Main model class with database operations
- **ApprovalRuleApprover class**: Related model for managing approver sequences
- **Key Features**:
  - Full database CRUD operations (save, findById, findByCompanyId, deleteById)
  - Automatic UUID generation
  - Database format conversion (camelCase ↔ snake_case)
  - Comprehensive validation method
  - Approver loading functionality

### 2. `backend/src/services/ApprovalRuleService.ts`
- **ApprovalRuleService class**: Business logic service with static methods
- **DTOs**: CreateApprovalRuleDTO and UpdateApprovalRuleDTO interfaces
- **Key Features**:
  - Transaction-based operations for data consistency
  - Comprehensive validation for all rule types
  - Authorization checks (company isolation)
  - Approver management with sequence validation

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 6.1 ✅
**"WHEN an Admin configures approval rules THEN the system SHALL support percentage-based rules"**
- Implemented `ApprovalRuleType.PERCENTAGE`
- Validates percentage threshold (1-100)
- Stores `percentageThreshold` field

### Requirement 6.2 ✅
**"WHEN an Admin configures approval rules THEN the system SHALL support specific approver rules"**
- Implemented `ApprovalRuleType.SPECIFIC_APPROVER`
- Validates specific approver exists and belongs to company
- Stores `specificApproverId` field

### Requirement 6.3 ✅
**"WHEN an Admin configures approval rules THEN the system SHALL support hybrid rules"**
- Implemented `ApprovalRuleType.HYBRID`
- Requires both percentage threshold AND specific approver
- Uses `isHybrid` flag for proper validation

## Task Requirements Completed

### ✅ Implement createApprovalRule method
- `ApprovalRuleService.createApprovalRule(data: CreateApprovalRuleDTO)`
- Validates all input data
- Creates rule and associated approvers in transaction
- Returns created rule with loaded approvers

### ✅ Implement getApprovalRulesByCompany method
- `ApprovalRuleService.getApprovalRulesByCompany(companyId: string)`
- Returns rules ordered by priority
- Loads approvers for each rule
- Company isolation enforced

### ✅ Implement updateApprovalRule method
- `ApprovalRuleService.updateApprovalRule(id, companyId, data: UpdateApprovalRuleDTO)`
- Partial updates supported
- Validates changes against rule type requirements
- Updates approvers if provided
- Authorization checks included

### ✅ Implement deleteApprovalRule method
- `ApprovalRuleService.deleteApprovalRule(id: string, companyId: string)`
- Checks for pending approval requests before deletion
- Authorization checks included
- Cascade deletion of approvers handled by database

### ✅ Add validation for rule types and thresholds
- **Sequential Rules**: Require at least one approver with consecutive sequences
- **Percentage Rules**: Validate threshold between 1-100
- **Specific Approver Rules**: Validate approver exists and belongs to company
- **Hybrid Rules**: Validate both percentage and specific approver requirements
- **General Validation**: Name required, company ID required, priority non-negative

## Validation Features

### Rule Type Specific Validation
1. **SEQUENTIAL**: Requires approvers array with consecutive sequences starting from 1
2. **PERCENTAGE**: Requires percentageThreshold (1-100)
3. **SPECIFIC_APPROVER**: Requires valid specificApproverId from same company
4. **HYBRID**: Requires both percentage threshold AND specific approver, plus isHybrid=true

### Approver Validation
- No duplicate approver IDs
- No duplicate sequence numbers
- Consecutive sequences starting from 1
- All approvers must exist and belong to the company
- Positive sequence numbers only

### Business Logic Validation
- Company isolation enforced
- Prevents deletion of rules with pending approvals
- Validates manager relationships
- Ensures data consistency with transactions

## Database Schema Compliance
- Matches existing migration structure exactly
- Uses proper foreign key relationships
- Supports all enum values defined in database
- Handles nullable fields correctly (percentage_threshold, specific_approver_id)

## Error Handling
- Descriptive error messages for all validation failures
- Proper error types for different scenarios
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Authorization error handling

## Design Document Compliance
- Implements all interfaces as specified in design.md
- Follows the same patterns as other models (User, Company, Expense)
- Uses consistent naming conventions
- Supports the workflow engine requirements

## Next Steps
This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Task 8.2: Create approval rule API endpoints
- Task 9: Implement Workflow Engine (will use these rules)
- Task 10: Implement Approval Service (will evaluate these rules)

The ApprovalRule model and service are now ready to be integrated with the API layer and workflow engine.
