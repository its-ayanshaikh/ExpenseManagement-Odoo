## New Services and Utilities Created

### 1. EmailService (`backend/src/services/EmailService.ts`)
A comprehensive email service that:
- Supports SMTP configuration via environment variables
- Falls back to console logging when SMTP is not configured
- Provides methods for:
  - `sendEmail()` - Generic email sending
  - `sendWelcomeEmail()` - Welcome email with credentials
  - `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Password reset email (for future use)
- Uses HTML templates for professional-looking emails
- Includes proper error handling

### 2. Password Utility (`backend/src/utils/password.ts`)
Password generation and validation utilities:
- `generateSecurePassword()` - Generates secure random passwords with:
  - Configurable length (default 12 characters)
  - Mixed case letters
  - Numbers
  - Special symbols
  - Guaranteed inclusion of at least one character from each category
  - Randomized character positions
- `validatePasswordStrength()` - Validates password meets security requirements

### 3. UserService Enhancement
Added new method to `backend/src/services/UserService.ts`:
- `generatePasswordAndSendEmail()` - Generates password, updates user, and sends email

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Added
Updated `.env.example` with email configuration:
```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=localhost
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@expensemanagement.com

# Frontend URL (for email links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Dependencies Installed
- `nodemailer` - Email sending library
- `@types/nodemailer` - TypeScript types for nodemailer

## Testing

### Integration Tests
Created comprehensive integration tests in `backend/src/__tests__/integration/users.integration.test.ts`:
- Tests for all user management endpoints
- Tests for the new generate-password endpoint
- Validates password generation and email sending
- Tests authentication and authorization
- Tests company isolation

### Test Results
- ✅ Generate password endpoint works correctly
- ✅ Email service successfully sends emails (logged to console in test mode)
- ✅ Password is properly hashed and stored
- ✅ Generated passwords meet security requirements

## Security Features

1. **Password Security**:
   - Secure random password generation using crypto module
   - Minimum 12 characters with mixed complexity
   - Passwords are hashed before storage using bcrypt

2. **Authorization**:
   - All endpoints require authentication
   - Most endpoints require admin role
   - Company isolation enforced on all endpoints

3. **Validation**:
   - Email format validation
   - Password strength validation
   - Role validation
   - Manager relationship validation
   - Circular relationship prevention

## API Response Examples

### Generate Password Success Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Password generated and email sent successfully",
  "data": {
    "userId": "uuid",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "6?Vn22?+7knV",
    "note": "Password has been sent to user via email"
  }
}
```

### Email Content
The welcome email includes:
- Professional HTML template
- User's credentials (email and temporary password)
- Login URL
- Instructions to change password
- Responsive design

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the task:
- ✅ 2.1 - User management
- ✅ 2.2 - User roles
- ✅ 2.3 - User creation
- ✅ 2.4 - User updates
- ✅ 2.5 - User deletion
- ✅ 2.6 - Role assignment
- ✅ 2.7 - Manager assignment
- ✅ 2.8 - User listing
- ✅ 2.13 - Email notifications
- ✅ 2.14 - Password generation
- ✅ 2.15 - Secure password requirements
- ✅ 7.1 - Company isolation
- ✅ 11.1-11.8 - Admin-only operations

## Notes

1. **Email Configuration**: The email service works in two modes:
   - **Production mode**: When EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_USER, and EMAIL_PASSWORD are configured, emails are sent via SMTP
   - **Development/Test mode**: When email is not configured, emails are logged to console for debugging

2. **Password in Response**: The generated password is included in the API response so admins can manually share it if email delivery fails. This is intentional for operational flexibility.

3. **Future Enhancements**: The EmailService includes a `sendPasswordResetEmail()` method for future password reset functionality.

## Conclusion

Task 5.3 has been successfully completed. All required user management API endpoints are implemented and working correctly, with proper authentication, authorization, validation, and company isolation. The new password generation feature includes secure password generation and email notification capabilities.
