# Task 7.2 Implementation Summary: Currency Conversion at Approval Time

## Overview
Implemented currency conversion that occurs at approval time rather than at expense creation. This ensures that exchange rates are current when expenses are approved, and the converted amount is stored permanently with the expense record.

## Changes Made

### 1. ExpenseService.ts
**Added `convertExpenseCurrency` method:**
- Fetches the expense and company information
- Checks if currency conversion is needed (skips if expense is already in company currency)
- Uses CurrencyService to fetch exchange rates (with 1-hour caching)
- Converts the expense amount to company's base currency
- Stores the converted amount and currency in the expense record
- Logs all conversion actions to ApprovalHistory
- Handles conversion failures gracefully with detailed error logging

**Key Features:**
- Case-insensitive currency comparison
- Automatic caching of exchange rates (1 hour TTL)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- No conversion when expense is already in company currency

### 2. WorkflowEngine.ts
**Modified `evaluateWorkflowCompletion` method:**
- Calls `convertAndApproveExpense` instead of directly approving
- Ensures currency conversion happens before approval

**Added `convertAndApproveExpense` method:**
- Calls `ExpenseService.convertExpenseCurrency` to perform conversion
- Updates expense status to APPROVED after successful conversion
- Handles conversion failures gracefully (still approves expense but logs warning)
- Logs workflow completion with appropriate status

**Behavior:**
- Currency conversion is attempted before every approval
- If conversion fails, expense is still approved (conversion failure doesn't block approval)
- All actions are logged to ApprovalHistory for audit trail

### 3. ApprovalService.ts
**Modified `adminOverrideApproval` method:**
- Added currency conversion before admin override approval
- Handles conversion failures gracefully
- Logs conversion warnings if conversion fails

**Behavior:**
- Admin overrides also trigger currency conversion
- Conversion failures don't prevent admin override

## Workflow Integration

### Normal Approval Flow:
1. Employee submits expense (no conversion, stores original amount/currency)
2. Expense goes through approval workflow
3. When all approvers approve:
   - `evaluateWorkflowCompletion` is called
   - `convertAndApproveExpense` is called
   - Currency conversion happens
   - Expense status is updated to APPROVED
   - Workflow completion is logged

### Admin Override Flow:
1. Admin overrides approval
2. Currency conversion is attempted
3. Expense is approved regardless of conversion success
4. Override action is logged

### Rejection Flow:
1. Any approver rejects expense
2. No currency conversion occurs
3. Expense status is updated to REJECTED

## Data Storage

### Before Approval (Draft/Pending):
- `amount`: Original amount
- `currency`: Original currency code
- `converted_amount`: 0
- `converted_currency`: Empty string

### After Approval:
- `amount`: Original amount (unchanged)
- `currency`: Original currency code (unchanged)
- `converted_amount`: Amount in company's base currency
- `converted_currency`: Company's base currency code

## Caching Strategy

Exchange rates are cached for 1 hour using Redis:
- Cache key format: `exchange_rates:{BASE_CURRENCY}`
- TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Automatic cache invalidation after TTL expires
- Reduces API calls to Exchange Rate API
- Maintains reasonable accuracy for approval decisions

## Error Handling

### Conversion Failures:
- Logged to ApprovalHistory with detailed error information
- Expense is still approved (conversion failure doesn't block approval)
- Warning message is logged for admin review

### API Failures:
- Network errors are caught and logged
- Timeout errors are handled gracefully
- API unavailability doesn't prevent expense approval

## Testing

### Unit Tests (currency-conversion-approval.test.ts):
- ✅ Convert expense from USD to EUR
- ✅ No conversion when expense is already in company currency
- ✅ Handle currency conversion failure gracefully
- ✅ Throw error if expense not found
- ✅ Throw error if company not found
- ✅ Handle case-insensitive currency comparison

### Integration Tests (workflow-currency-conversion.test.ts):
- ✅ Convert currency when all approvers approve
- ✅ Still approve expense if currency conversion fails
- ✅ Not convert currency when expense is rejected

### Existing Tests:
- ✅ All existing ExpenseService tests pass (22 tests)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- **5.2**: Manager views expense with automatic currency conversion
- **5.3**: Exchange rates fetched from API
- **5.4**: Amount converted to company's base currency
- **5.5**: Original amount and currency displayed alongside converted amount
- **5.6**: Converted amount stored with expense record
- **5.7**: Optional comments on approval
- **5.9**: Manager takes approval action updates status immediately
- **5.10**: Manager views team expenses with converted amounts
- **9.1**: System fetches country and currency data
- **9.2**: Company has base currency code
- **9.3**: Employee submits expense in any currency (stores original)
- **9.4**: Manager/Admin views expense with current exchange rates
- **9.5**: Exchange rates used to convert to company base currency
- **9.6**: Both converted and original amounts displayed
- **9.7**: Converted amount stored on approval
- **9.8**: Exchange rates cached for 1 hour
- **9.9**: Error handling for API unavailability
- **9.10**: No conversion for expenses in company base currency

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Exchange Rates**: Conversion happens at approval time with current rates
2. **Performance**: 1-hour caching minimizes API calls
3. **Reliability**: Conversion failures don't block approvals
4. **Audit Trail**: All conversions logged to ApprovalHistory
5. **Transparency**: Original and converted amounts both stored
6. **Flexibility**: Supports any currency pair through external API

## Next Steps

The currency conversion is now fully integrated into the approval workflow. The next task (7.3) will implement the expense submission API endpoints that utilize this functionality.
