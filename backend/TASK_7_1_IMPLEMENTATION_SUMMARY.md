# Task 7.1 Implementation Summary: ExpenseService CRUD Operations

## Overview
Implemented the ExpenseService with complete CRUD operations supporting the draft/submit workflow pattern as specified in the requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definitions (`backend/src/types/database.ts`)
- Added `DRAFT` status to `ExpenseStatus` enum
- Added new `ExpenseCategory` enum with three categories:
  - `AMOUNT_TO_SUBMIT` - Draft expenses not yet submitted
  - `WAITING_APPROVAL` - Submitted expenses pending approval
  - `APPROVED` - Approved expenses

### 2. Database Migration (`backend/src/migrations/20240101000009_add_draft_status_to_expenses.ts`)
- Created migration to add `DRAFT` value to the `expense_status` enum in PostgreSQL
- Migration executed successfully

### 3. Updated Expense Model (`backend/src/models/Expense.ts`)
- Changed default status from `PENDING` to `DRAFT` in constructor

### 4. Refactored ExpenseService (`backend/src/services/ExpenseService.ts`)

#### New Methods Implemented:

**a) saveDraftExpense(data: CreateExpenseDTO): Promise<Expense>**
- Saves expense as draft without submitting for approval
- Sets status to `DRAFT`
- Does not perform currency conversion (deferred until approval)
- Does not initiate workflow
- Validates submitter exists and belongs to company

**b) submitExpense(expenseId: string): Promise<Expense>**
- Submits a draft expense for approval
- Changes status from `DRAFT` to `PENDING`
- Sets category to `WAITING_APPROVAL`
- Logs submission in approval history
- Initiates approval workflow via WorkflowEngine

**c) getExpensesByCategory(userId: string, category: ExpenseCategory): Promise<Expense[]>**
- Retrieves expenses filtered by category
- Maps categories to statuses:
  - `AMOUNT_TO_SUBMIT` → `DRAFT`
  - `WAITING_APPROVAL` → `PENDING`
  - `APPROVED` → `APPROVED`
- Orders by creation date (descending)

#### Updated Methods:

**d) updateExpense(id: string, data: UpdateExpenseDTO, userId: string): Promise<Expense>**
- Now only allows updates to `DRAFT` expenses
- Throws error if expense has been submitted
- Removed currency conversion logic (not needed for drafts)
- Validates user ownership

**e) deleteExpense(id: string, userId: string): Promise<boolean>**
- Now only allows deletion of `DRAFT` expenses
- Throws error if expense has been submitted
- Validates user ownership

#### Existing Methods (Verified):

**f) getExpenseById(id: string): Promise<Expense | null>**
- Retrieves single expense by ID
- Returns null if not found

**g) getExpensesByUser(userId: string, filters?: ExpenseFilters): Promise<Expense[]>**
- Retrieves all expenses for a user
- Supports filtering by status, date range, and category

**h) getExpensesByCompany(companyId: string, filters?: ExpenseFilters): Promise<Expense[]>**
- Retrieves all expenses for a company (Admin only)
- Supports filtering by status, submitter, date range, and category

**i) getPendingApprovalsForUser(userId: string): Promise<Expense[]>**
- Retrieves expenses pending approval for a manager
- Validates user is a manager or admin
- Returns expenses where user is an approver

**j) createExpense(data: CreateExpenseDTO): Promise<Expense>** (Legacy)
- Marked as deprecated
- Now internally calls `saveDraftExpense` then `submitExpense`
- Maintained for backward compatibility

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite (`backend/src/__tests__/unit/expense-service.test.ts`)

Created 22 unit tests covering:
- Draft expense creation
- Expense submission workflow
- Category-based filtering
- Update and delete restrictions
- User ownership validation
- Error handling for invalid operations
- Manager approval access control

**Test Results: All 22 tests passing ✓**

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Draft-First Approach**: Expenses are created as drafts by default, requiring explicit submission
2. **Category-Status Mapping**: Categories are derived from status for consistency
3. **Deferred Currency Conversion**: Conversion happens at approval time, not creation
4. **Strict Draft-Only Modifications**: Updates and deletes only work on draft expenses
5. **Workflow Separation**: Workflow initiation only happens on submission, not creation

## Requirements Satisfied

All requirements from task 7.1 have been implemented:
- ✓ saveDraftExpense method (status=DRAFT, category=AMOUNT_TO_SUBMIT)
- ✓ submitExpense method (status=PENDING, category=WAITING_APPROVAL, initiates workflow)
- ✓ getExpenseById method
- ✓ getExpensesByUser method
- ✓ getExpensesByCategory method (filters by AMOUNT_TO_SUBMIT, WAITING_APPROVAL, APPROVED)
- ✓ getExpensesByCompany method (Admin only)
- ✓ getPendingApprovalsForUser method (Manager)
- ✓ updateExpense method (only for draft expenses)
- ✓ deleteExpense method (only for draft expenses)

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       22 passed, 22 total
```

## Next Steps

The ExpenseService is now ready for integration with:
- Task 7.2: Currency conversion at approval time
- Task 7.3: Expense submission API endpoints
- Frontend expense management UI (Tasks 16-18)
