# Task 8 Implementation Summary: Approval Rule Configuration with 3-Part System

## Overview
Implemented the approval rule configuration system with a 3-part architecture that supports:
1. **Employee-level Manager Approval** - Configured per employee via `isManagerApprover` flag
2. **Required Approvers** - Managers marked as mandatory approvers with `isRequired` flag
3. **Sequential vs Parallel Approval** - Toggle between sequential and parallel approval workflows

## Files Created

### Models
1. **backend/src/models/ApprovalRule.ts**
   - Model for approval rules with `isSequentialApproval` field
   - CRUD operations for approval rules
   - Company-based filtering

2. **backend/src/models/ApprovalRuleApprover.ts**
   - Model for approval rule approvers with `isRequired` field
   - Sequence-based ordering
   - Relationship management between rules and approvers

### Services
3. **backend/src/services/ApprovalRuleService.ts**
   - `createApprovalRule()` - Creates approval rule with approvers
   - `getApprovalRuleById()` - Retrieves rule with approver details
   - `getApprovalRulesByCompany()` - Lists all rules for a company
   - `updateApprovalRule()` - Updates rule and approvers
   - `deleteApprovalRule()` - Deletes rule and cascades to approvers
   - `getRequiredApprovers()` - Gets required approvers for a company
   - `isSequentialApprovalEnabled()` - Checks if sequential approval is enabled
   - Validation for:
     - Approver existence and company membership
     - Manager/Admin role requirements
     - Unique sequence numbers
     - Consecutive sequence numbering (1, 2, 3...)
     - No duplicate approvers

### Routes
4. **backend/src/routes/approval-rules.ts** (Updated)
   - `POST /api/approval-rules` - Create approval rule (Admin only)
   - `GET /api/approval-rules` - List all approval rules (Admin only)
   - `GET /api/approval-rules/:id` - Get specific approval rule (Admin only)
   - `PUT /api/approval-rules/:id` - Update approval rule (Admin only)
   - `DELETE /api/approval-rules/:id` - Delete approval rule (Admin only)
   - All endpoints enforce authentication and admin-only access
   - Company isolation enforced

### Database
5. **backend/src/migrations/20240101000010_add_approval_rule_3part_system.ts**
   - Added `is_sequential_approval` boolean field to `approval_rules` table
   - Added `is_required` boolean field to `approval_rule_approvers` table

6. **backend/src/types/database.ts** (Updated)
   - Updated `ApprovalRule` interface with `is_sequential_approval` field
   - Updated `ApprovalRuleApprover` interface with `is_required` field

### Tests
7. **backend/src/__tests__/unit/approval-rule-service.test.ts**
   - Unit tests for ApprovalRuleService
   - Tests for validation logic
   - Tests for CRUD operations
   - All tests passing ✅

8. **backend/src/__tests__/integration/approval-rule-endpoints.test.ts**
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Tests for sequential and parallel approval creation
   - Tests for validation and error handling
   - Note: Requires WorkflowEngine updates (Task 9) to run fully

## Database Schema Changes

### approval_rules table
```sql
ALTER TABLE approval_rules 
ADD COLUMN is_sequential_approval BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```

### approval_rule_approvers table
```sql
ALTER TABLE approval_rule_approvers 
ADD COLUMN is_required BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```

## API Request/Response Examples

### Create Approval Rule
**Request:**
```json
POST /api/approval-rules
{
  "name": "Sequential Approval Rule",
  "isSequentialApproval": true,
  "priority": 1,
  "approvers": [
    {
      "approverId": "manager-1-id",
      "isRequired": true,
      "sequence": 1
    },
    {
      "approverId": "manager-2-id",
      "isRequired": true,
      "sequence": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Approval rule created successfully",
  "data": {
    "approvalRule": {
      "id": "rule-id",
      "companyId": "company-id",
      "name": "Sequential Approval Rule",
      "ruleType": "SEQUENTIAL",
      "isSequentialApproval": true,
      "priority": 1,
      "approvers": [
        {
          "id": "approver-1-id",
          "approverId": "manager-1-id",
          "approverName": "John Doe",
          "approverEmail": "john@company.com",
          "isRequired": true,
          "sequence": 1
        },
        {
          "id": "approver-2-id",
          "approverId": "manager-2-id",
          "approverName": "Jane Smith",
          "approverEmail": "jane@company.com",
          "isRequired": true,
          "sequence": 2
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Approver Validation
- At least one approver required
- Approvers must exist in the database
- Approvers must belong to the same company
- Approvers must have Manager or Admin role
- No duplicate approvers allowed

### Sequence Validation (for Sequential Approval)
- Sequence numbers must be unique
- Sequence numbers must start from 1
- Sequence numbers must be consecutive (1, 2, 3...)

## Integration with 3-Part System

### Part 1: Employee-Level Manager Approval
- Configured in User model via `isManagerApprover` field
- When enabled, employee's expenses route to their manager first
- Implemented in Task 5 (User Management)

### Part 2: Required Approvers
- Configured in ApprovalRuleApprover model via `isRequired` field
- Managers marked as required must approve for expense to be approved
- If any required approver rejects, expense is auto-rejected

### Part 3: Sequential vs Parallel Approval
- Configured in ApprovalRule model via `isSequentialApproval` field
- **Sequential (true)**: Approvals happen in order (1 → 2 → 3)
- **Parallel (false)**: All approvers receive requests simultaneously

## Workflow Flow

```
Expense Submitted
       ↓
[Part 1] Is Manager Approver enabled?
       ↓ Yes                    ↓ No
Manager Approval          Skip to Part 2
       ↓
[Part 2] Get Required Approvers
       ↓
[Part 3] Is Sequential Approval?
       ↓ Yes                    ↓ No
Sequential Flow          Parallel Flow
(1 → 2 → 3)             (All at once)
       ↓                        ↓
All Required Approved?   All Required Approved?
       ↓ Yes                    ↓ Yes
Expense Approved         Expense Approved
```

## Next Steps (Task 9)

The WorkflowEngine service needs to be updated to use the new 3-part system:
1. Update `initiateWorkflow()` to check `isSequentialApproval`
2. Update `processApproval()` to handle required approvers
3. Update approval logic to use `isRequired` flag
4. Remove old rule type logic (PERCENTAGE, SPECIFIC_APPROVER, HYBRID)
5. Update test helpers to use new structure

## Testing Status

✅ Unit Tests: All passing (10/10)
⚠️  Integration Tests: Pending WorkflowEngine updates (Task 9)

## Migration Status

✅ Migration executed successfully
✅ Database schema updated
✅ No data loss or conflicts
