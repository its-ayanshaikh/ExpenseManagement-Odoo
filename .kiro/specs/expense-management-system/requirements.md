# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Expense Management System designed to streamline and automate the expense reimbursement process for companies. The system addresses manual, time-consuming, and error-prone processes by providing automated approval workflows, multi-level approvals, flexible approval rules, and OCR-based receipt scanning. The system supports multi-currency operations and provides role-based access control for Admins, Managers, and Employees.

## Requirements

5. WHEN a current approver approves an expense THEN the system SHALL automatically generate an approval request for the next approver in sequence
6. WHEN a current approver rejects an expense THEN the system SHALL halt the workflow and mark the expense as Rejected

8. WHEN an approval request is generated THEN the system SHALL notify the designated approver

### Requirement 5: Manager Approval Actions

### Requirement 6: Conditional Approval Rules

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to configure conditional approval rules based on percentages or specific approvers, so that expenses can be approved more efficiently without requiring all approvers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin configures approval rules THEN the system SHALL support percentage-based rules (e.g., 60% of approvers must approve)
