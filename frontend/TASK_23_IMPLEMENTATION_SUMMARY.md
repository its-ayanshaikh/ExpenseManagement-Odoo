```

#### AccessibleForm
```typescript
// Form wrapper with proper accessibility features
<AccessibleForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} title="Form Title">
  <FormSection title="Personal Information">
    <TextField label="Name" required />
  </FormSection>
  <FormActions>
    <FormButton type="submit" variant="primary">Submit</FormButton>
  </FormActions>
</AccessibleForm>
```

#### ResponsiveContainer
```typescript
// Provides consistent responsive behavior
<ResponsiveContainer maxWidth="lg" padding="md">
  <ResponsiveGrid columns={{ xs: 1, md: 2, lg: 3 }}>
    <TouchTarget onClick={handleClick} size="md">
      Button content
    </TouchTarget>
  </ResponsiveGrid>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

### Enhanced Hooks

#### useResponsive
```typescript
const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop, breakpoint } = useResponsive()
```

#### useAccessibility
```typescript
const { 
  announce,           // Screen reader announcements
  saveFocus,         // Save current focus
  restoreFocus,      // Restore saved focus
  trapFocus          // Focus trapping for modals
} = useAccessibility()
```
