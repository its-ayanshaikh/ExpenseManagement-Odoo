# Logout on API Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was automatically logging users out on ANY API error, making it extremely difficult to debug issues because:
- Users would be kicked to login page before seeing the actual error
- Console errors would be lost when redirected
- Network errors, server errors, and validation errors all triggered logout

## Root Causes

### 1. API Interceptor (api.ts)
- Was forcing logout and redirect on ANY 401 error
- Didn't distinguish between authentication endpoints and regular API calls
- Would redirect to login immediately, even on temporary network issues

### 2. AuthContext - refreshUser()
- Would automatically logout on ANY error when refreshing user data
- Didn't distinguish between authentication errors and network/server errors

### 3. AuthContext - Auto-refresh Token
- Would logout on ANY error during token refresh
- Didn't handle network errors gracefully
- Would logout even on temporary server issues

### 4. AuthContext - Initialize Auth
- Would clear tokens on ANY error during initialization
- Didn't distinguish between invalid tokens and network issues

## Solution

### 1. API Interceptor Changes
**Before:**
- Logged out on any 401 error
- Forced redirect to login page
- No distinction between error types

**After:**
- Only attempts token refresh for non-auth endpoints
- Doesn't force logout in the interceptor
- Lets errors propagate naturally
- Removed automatic redirects
- Token refresh failures are logged but don't force logout

### 2. AuthContext - refreshUser() Changes
**Before:**
```typescript
if (err.response?.status === 401) {
  await logout()
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Don't auto-logout on refresh user errors
// Let the user stay logged in and see the error
// They can manually logout if needed
```

### 3. AuthContext - Auto-refresh Token Changes
**Before:**
```typescript
catch (err) {
  console.error('Token refresh failed:', err)
  clearInterval(refreshInterval)
  await logout()
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
catch (err: any) {
  console.error('Token refresh failed:', err)
  // Only logout if it's a 401 error (invalid refresh token)
  // Don't logout on network errors or other temporary issues
  if (err?.response?.status === 401 || err?.statusCode === 401) {
    clearInterval(refreshInterval)
    await logout()
  }
  // For other errors, keep trying on next interval
}
```

### 4. AuthContext - Initialize Auth Changes
**Before:**
```typescript
if (err.response?.status === 401) {
  setAccessToken(null)
  setRefreshToken(null)
  setUser(null)
  setCompany(null)
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only clear tokens if it's a 401 error (invalid token)
// For network errors or other issues, keep the user logged in
if (err?.response?.status === 401 || err?.statusCode === 401 || err?.type === 'AUTHENTICATION') {
  setAccessToken(null)
  setRefreshToken(null)
  setUser(null)
  setCompany(null)
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging Experience**
   - Users stay logged in when API errors occur
   - Can see actual error messages in the UI
   - Console errors remain visible
   - Can inspect network tab without being redirected

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - No unexpected logouts on temporary network issues
   - No logouts on server errors (500, 502, etc.)
   - No logouts on validation errors (400, 422)
   - Only logout on actual authentication failures (401)

3. **More Resilient Application**
   - Handles network issues gracefully
   - Continues to retry token refresh on temporary failures
   - Doesn't lose user session on transient errors

## When Logout WILL Still Happen

Logout will only occur in these specific cases:
1. User manually clicks logout button
2. Refresh token is invalid (401 response from /auth/refresh)
3. Access token is invalid AND refresh token is invalid (both 401)
4. Initial auth check fails with 401 (invalid stored token)

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Cause a network error (disconnect internet briefly)
   - ✅ User should stay logged in
   - ✅ Error message should be visible
   
2. Cause a server error (backend returns 500)
   - ✅ User should stay logged in
   - ✅ Error message should be visible
   
3. Cause a validation error (send invalid data)
   - ✅ User should stay logged in
   - ✅ Validation error should be visible
   
4. Use an invalid/expired token
   - ✅ User should be logged out (expected behavior)
